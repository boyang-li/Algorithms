## Algorithms

### Welcome! This is a place where I keep my solutions & notes for data structures & algorithm problems. I use Python for the purpose of simplicity, and I  also implement solutions in various programming languages if I wanted to practice a certain language or optimize for execution times.

> Most problems in this repo are collected from online resources such as LeetCode, and this repo is created soley for learning purposes.
