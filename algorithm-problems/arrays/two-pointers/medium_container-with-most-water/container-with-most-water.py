    # Two pointer approach
    #
    # Notes:
    # Initially we consider the area constituting the exterior most lines. Now, to
    # maximize the area, we need to consider the area between the lines of larger
    # lengths. If we try to move the pointer at the longer line inwards, we won't
    # gain any increase in area, since it is limited by the shorter line. But moving
    # the shorter line's pointer could turn out to be beneficial, as per the same
    # argument, despite the reduction in the width. This is done since a relatively
    # longer line obtained by moving the shorter line's pointer might overcome the
    # the reduction in area caused by the width reduction.
    #
    # Complexity:
    # O(n) time | O(1) space
