# Notes:
# A clever optimal solution solves it by having a single forward loop to
# calculate the running products of all the elements to the left up until the
# current index, and then having a single backward loop to calculate the running
# products of all the elements to the right up until the current index.
#
# Note that the running products calculated by the second backward loop are
# accumelated products based on the running products calculated by the first
# loop.
#
# By this setup, each elements in the result array would be the running product
# of all the values to its left and right.
#
# Complexity:
# O(n) time | O(n) space - where n is the length of the input array.
