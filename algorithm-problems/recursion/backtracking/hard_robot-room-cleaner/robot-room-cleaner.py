# LeetCode 489. Robot Room Cleaner
#
# Notes:
# This is a problem that can be solved using backtracking. There two main
# concepts involved in the solution:
#
# 1. constrained programming - That basically means to put restrictions after
# each robot move. Robot moves, and the cell is marked as visited. That
# propagates constraints and helps to reduce the number of combinations to
# consider.
#
# 2.backtracking - Let's imagine that after several moves the robot is
# surrounded by the visited cells. But several steps before there was a cell
# which proposed an alternative path to go. That path wasn't used and hence the
# room is not yet cleaned up. What to do? To backtrack. That means to come back
# to that cell, and to explore the alternative path.
#
# The algorithm can be broke down as the following:
# - Mark the cell as visited and clean it up.
# - Explore 4 directions : up, right, down, and left (the order is important
#   since the idea is always to turn right):
#     - Check the next cell in the chosen direction :
#       - If it's not visited yet and there is no obtacles :
#           - Move forward.
#           - Explore next cells backtrack(new_cell, new_direction).
#           - Backtrack, i.e. go back to the previous cell.
#       - Turn right because now there is an obstacle (or a virtual obstacle)
#         just in front, and we explore an alternative path.
#
# Complexity:
# O(n - m) time | O(n - m) space - where n is the number of cells i nthe room,
# and m is the number of obstacles.
# time complexity:
#   - We visit each non-obstacle cell once and only once;
#   - At each visit, we will check 4 directions around the cell. Therefore, the
#     total number of operations would be 4(n âˆ’ m).
# space complexity:
#   - We employed a hashtable to keep track of whether a non-obstacle cell is
#     visited or not.
